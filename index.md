Ashwin Karthik established himself as a true achiever from the very moment of his birth. He was born with a deficient supply of oxygen, which resulted in a crippling and life-long condition called cerebral palsy. He is a quadriplegic, with the severest form of cerebral palsy that affects all four limbs. But, as though to balance his misfortune, he is blessed with an indomitable spirit and the will to take on an almost impossible challenge of leading and succeeding in a world full of people without disadvantages.

From his schools days, Ashwin’s record reflects what he has been striving to do earnestly. In 1999, Ashwin scored 84% in his SSLC exams; the highest percentage ever scored by a student with cerebral palsy. In 2003, he received the National Scholarship for his engineering studies, given to just one physically challenged student across the entire country. He is the first quadriplegic cerebral palsy student in India to have become an engineering graduate.

Ashwin worked with Mphasis for 7.5 years and then served ANZ almost 4 years as a business analyst. Currently is working in the capacity of an Advisor to project Management at DellEMC.

His choice of three heroes in life reflects his multi-faceted personality:
- His mother, who nurtured him and brought him up, harnessing her enormous will power, dedication and infinite love for her son.
- His second hero is Sachin Tendulkar, who Ashwin thinks has made a billion people happy, and has made each one of us feel proud to be an Indian. He hopes to emulate “at least a fraction of what Sachin has done for the spirit of his countrymen”.
- His third hero is the celebrated British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who, though crippled by a neuro-degenerative disease, has made original contributions in the field of cosmology and quantum gravity.

We can see that Ashwin’s heroes are a well thought-out selection, reflective of his deep and rich perspective and his own aspirations: they traverse from a local and intensely emotional plane—though a sporting hero and an inspiring national icon—to an international and highly intellectual plane. Only a poet would have a mind-map like this!
Ashwin is indeed a poet. He writes poetry in English, Kannada and Hindi.
